Displaying the student records which includes first name, last name and skills. So here I have used django and ReactJs for the project.

A full stack application was built using ReactJs and django. Used REST Api for communicating from backend to frontend.

Setting up your virtual environment:
python3 -m venv .env

Activating Virtual Environment
source .env/bin/activate
Once the repository is cloned and virtual environment set up, go to the directory where the requirements.txt(Student-Record/backend/) is and type the following code in your terminal:

pip install requirements.txt
Then to run the server and type the following code in terminal:

python3 manage.py makemigrations
